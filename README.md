### Hey! I'm [@Kevin_KuanHsuan](https://twitter.com/Kevin_KuanHsuan) (Kevin Shen) ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a postdoc at Georgia Institute of Technology. 

In 2022 summer, I interned at [@GoogleChrome](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard) for [Chrome Platform Status](https://chromestatus.com/roadmap). Check out my [contribution summary](https://kevinshen56714.github.io/chromestatus-intern)!


I like to build open source products with TypeScript (and JavaScript), Python, SQL and NoSQL databases, and modern full-stack frameworks. ðŸ¤– My proud projects include:

- [**SkyOffice**](https://sky-office.co/) - A browser-based virtual office, been on GitHub Trending and HackerNews! [![SkyOffice GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kevinshen56714/SkyOffice.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SkyOffice)
- [**SWEJobs.fyi**](https://swejobs.fyi/) - Software engineer jobs and trends tracker, my current focus. [![SWEJobs GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kevinshen56714/SWEJobs.fyi.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SWEJobs.fyi) 

I also have been building tools for data systems and machine Learning. ðŸš€ Check out:

I have helped some teams and organizations with my projects. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to **contact me**. ðŸ¤“ And if my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also sponsor my work on them. â˜•
